Different TLA+ specifications, mostly for learning purposes
===========================================================

CigaretteSmokers.tla
--------------------

A specification of the [Cigarette smokers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_smokers_problem).
The generated state graph is very small:

Blinker.tla
-----------

Simple spec simulating, more or less, [this](https://github.com/mryndzionek/esm/blob/master/apps/blink/src/blink.c) application.
Three state machines controlling three LEDs. With 100ms resolution (model run with `BC <- <<3, 5, 7>>`) model checker
finds 384 distinct states:

Just a humble reminder to never underestimate even the simplest concurrent programs, I guess :smiley:

GameOfLife.tla
--------------

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

![spec3](images/GameOfLife.png)

All the 'attractors' for a 3x3 grid

State space for a 4x4 grid - original image generated by Graphviz is around 300MB :smiley::

The same with some colors based on number of occupied cells:

Zoom on two of the smaller clusters:

![fig7](images/gameoflife_4x4cz2.png)

Under 'symmetry group of the square' (D<sub>4</sub>) view in TLC the state space shrinks to ... 27 states.
Under this view it's even possible to run TLC on 5x5 grid and get 486 states (reduction from 33554432):

Base Graphviz parameters:

```sh
dot -Tpng -Nstyle=filled -Npenwidth=5 -Epenwidth=8 -Ksfdp -Goverlap=prism -Goverlap_scaling=-10
```

Requirements.tla
----------------

Experimental specification aimed at mechanising verification of written requirements documents.

![spec5](images/CheckRequirements.png)

Checking `CheckRequirements` spec produces:
